%Intialises the model parameters for the Kalman Filter from the initial
%state and the sampling interval;
%calls kf function on the specified state sequence;
%returns the list of coordinates from kf output.
%Input:
%estimated_coord: a nb_states-by-2 matrix returned by LLS or WLS
%intial_state: intial state estimate, needed to start the Kalman Filter;
%intial_state = [0, 0, 0, 0] or intial_state = [0, 0]
%T_s: sampling interval, or distance travelled between two states (T_s = 1 m)
%Output:
%filtered_coord: a nb_states-by-2 matrix with the estimated coordinates
%passed through the Kalman Filter
